&lt;p&gt;Four months ago, I arrived at Canada and began a new adventure–being an ECE Master student in University of Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love programming. I believe science technology is improving and will continually improve people’s life. So, I plan to develop a career which can devote my contribution to this inspiration process after my graduation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I possess strong background in communication and signal processing area. When it comes to programming, I know I need to learn much more. But, I’m working on it and, what’more, I enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is used to record my adventure in programming. Including what I learn and what I think, anything related will be covered. If it nicely help you a tiny bit, I’ll be very happy,too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any advice and correction is highly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="blog"></category></entry></feed>
