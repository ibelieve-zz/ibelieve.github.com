    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have experienced many adventures, both physically and mentally, in my 25 years old life.</p>

<p>Four months ago, I arrived at Canada and began a new adventure--being an ECE Master student in University of Waterloo.</p>

<p>I love programming. I believe science technology is improving and will continually improve people's life. So, I plan to develop a career which can devote my contribution to this inspiration process after my graduation.</p>

<p>I possess strong background in communication and signal processing area. When it comes to programming, I know I need to learn much more. But, I'm working on it and, what'more, I enjoy it!</p>

<hr/>


<p>This blog is used to record my adventure in programming. Including what I learn and what I think, anything related will be covered. If it nicely help you a tiny bit, I'll be very happy,too.</p>

<p>Any advice and correction is highly appreciated.</p>
